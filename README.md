# Djikstra-algorithm-implementation-for-a-point-robot
Implement djikstra on a point robot

To run the program ensure that you have the following libraries:
time, pygame, numpy, queue


# Sample Planning Scene
- Obstacle Space is represented in Red Color
- Explored nodes are represented in Green Color
- Final Path is represented by the Black Color.

## Sample 1 (Demonstrates that Code Works)
- Start Position- (6,9)
- Goal Position-  (69,69)
